# TryHackMe Guides and Files 

```
these are folders of try hack me rooms that i have completed and wrote (sometimes) extensive notes 
as well as my thought processon them.
i also upload the files i used and/or obtained from the room.
if there is no gobuster/nmap scans logs in the folder, then they must have either failed
or been useless. I will cover what the scans show in the readme
```
```
This repo is not meant to spoil the rooms but more for 
learning and to help when the pentester gets stuck
```
```json
keep in mind i have kept the answers in the guides like the flags or question answers
```
```
thanks for checking the repo out
